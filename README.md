TODO
- sanitize and comment tokenizer
- combine inputArgs and getInputURL
- comment sort links
- better readme with running instructions

### limitations
- no .js rendering
- does not support switching between http and https in the same domain
- does not support hyperlinks to local files (e.g. a pdf hyperlink)

### possible future additional features
- visit the root domain of any supplied URL first
- support http/https changes on the same host as the same domain
- also list links to non http/https schemes (such as a PDF link)
